# The Fortified Testing Philosophy Website

## Developing

To run the webpage locally, you just need to statically serve its files, which can be done through a command such as:

```sh
npx live-server ./public
```

## Changes

Minor changes that fix spelling/grammar errors, or that improve the wording of content are fine and are expected to happen periodically. The collapsable sections are also intended to be more relax, and can be altered more freely. Major changes, such as the addition of new sections or a change in stated opinion will instead be placed into a draft. When enough changes have been added to a draft, it will be released as the next revision.
